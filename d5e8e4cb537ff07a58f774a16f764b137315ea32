If, in https://gerrit.akraino.org/r/#/c/ta/hw-detector/+/1077/2/src/hw_detector/hw_detect_lib.py you had added \"ipmi_priv_level\u003d\u0027ADMINISTRATOR\u0027\" after \"detect_virtual\u003dTrue\" then this call would work properly.\n\nBecause you inserted the new parameter before an existing parameter (albeit one with a default) you caused this non-keyword call to supply \"False\" as the value for \"ipmi_priv_level\" instead of for \"detect_virtual\" as it was supposed to.",
