      "message": "This should fix it, but I think your real mistake was in not adding the new parameter to the end of the function definition. If, in https://gerrit.akraino.org/r/#/c/ta/hw-detector/+/1077/2/src/hw_detector/hw_detect_lib.py you had added \"ipmi_priv_level\u003d\u0027ADMINISTRATOR\u0027\" after \"detect_virtual\u003dTrue\" then this call would work properly.\n\nBecause you inserted the new parameter before an existing parameter (albeit one with a default) you caused this non-keyword call to supply \"False\" as the value for \"ipmi_priv_level\" instead of for \"detect_virtual\" as it was supposed to.",

      "message": "Yep, I\u0027m aware of why the problem happened.  My decision to add the parameter where I did was a considered one â€” the preceding arguments are all about IPMI, whereas the last argument is not.  I decided that keeping the interface to the function rather clean was worth the risk of breakage for things that didn\u0027t use keyword arguments.  Given nobody complained about the choice there, I took that as approval of the decision.",
